If you where to set new servers with this deployment remember to:

manually create the din folder with the credentials files

if it is a support server, you have to resolve how to propagate the keys from
the server that actually negotiates them to it, not sure on what happens if each
server negotiates its own certificate.

you have to setup systemctl .service file so that the server is always up.
